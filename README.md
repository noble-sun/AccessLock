# AccessLock

AccessLock is a Android app that locks the applications you want behind an authentication via fingerprint or the phone password, so that you can have an extra layer of protection for those apps that do not provide this kind of feature.
There are multiple apps like this on the Play Store, but I want my without adds.

## Features
- [ ] List of apps and system apps so that you can select which ones you want to lock
- [ ] Timer between needding to authenticate again when the app is in the background and is brought to foreground again
- [ ] Block NFC function when the apps are behind the authentication
- [ ] Don't allow taking print screens for those times there's a delay when rendering the authentication screen
